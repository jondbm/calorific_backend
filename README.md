#Calorific backend

Backend server for Calorific macronutrition tracker application, built with Laravel 5

This application uses the JWT-Auth JSON web token authentication demonstration module from Tymon and extends it with a database layer that parses route requests from the client side app and interacts with the main Calorific datbase.

The JWT-Auth module handles registering users and managing tokens, while the CaloriesController handles the logic for the application itself.
